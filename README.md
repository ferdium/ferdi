# Ferdi
This repository contains the latest release (code and executables) from the unstable Ferdi project. Please note that we are not continuing with the name Ferdi.

### Migrate
We have created a [migration guide](MIGRATION.md) on how to export/migrate from Ferdi to a local account. You can use this to migrate your configurations to Ferdium.

### Future
We are working on the continuation of the Ferdi project with the community called [ferdium](https://github.com/ferdium/ferdium-app). Please join our Discord to help us via [this invite link](https://discord.gg/xpNTzgKmHM)
